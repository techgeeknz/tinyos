This directory contains kernel configuration fragments for prepare-kernel.sh.

Usage:
- Place one or more *.fragment or *.frag files here.
- Files are applied in lexicographic order; later ones override earlier ones.
  (Use numeric prefixes like 10-core.fragment, 20-fs.fragment to control order.)
- Each file should contain valid Kconfig lines, e.g.:
    CONFIG_FOO=y
    CONFIG_BAR=m
    # CONFIG_BAZ is not set

Tip: keep fragments small and thematic (e.g., fs.fragment, drm.fragment),
so theyâ€™re easy to maintain and replace.
