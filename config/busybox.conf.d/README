This directory contains BusyBox configuration fragments for prepare-busybox.sh.

Usage:
- Place one or more *.fragment or *.frag files here.
- Files are applied in lexicographic order; later ones override earlier ones.
  (Use numeric prefixes like 10-core.fragment, 20-utils.fragment to control order.)
- Each file should contain valid BusyBox .config lines, e.g.:
    CONFIG_STATIC=y
    CONFIG_FEATURE_INSTALLER=y
    # CONFIG_SELINUX is not set

Tip: split features into logical groups and apply only what you need for TinyOS.
